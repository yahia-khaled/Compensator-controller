# Compensator-controller <br />
design compensator using sisotool in matlab to acheive specified phase margin <br />
# project description <br />
given control loop we need to achieve specified error steady state, so it is required to design compensator controller <br />
the challange is to select appropriate values for controller and proprtional gain to achieve required response.<br />
# simulation tool and version
projects run over matlab R2021a, using sisotool build in matlab that take control loop for design. <br />
