# Compensator-controller <br />
design compensator using sisotool in matlab to acheive specified phase margin <br />
# project description <br />
given control loop we need to achieve specified error steady state, so it is required to design compensator controller <br />
the challange is to select appropriate values for controller and proprtional gain to achieve required response.<br />
# simulation tool and version
projects run over matlab R2021a, using sisotool build in matlab that take control loop for design. <br />
# how to use project code
1. convert control loop transfer function from s-domain to z-domain
2. convert control loop transfer function from z-domain to w-domain to enable view bode plot and step response
3. plot step response and get bode plot of control loop transfer function
4. first you need to enter error steady state required
5.
